## Phase 2: User Centered Design

  When designing the wireframe for our app, a lot of the work was done for us since we are designing it based off an app that existed once (Yik-Yak). And thanks to our research, we learned that half of our responders used Yik-Yak when it was available, making us comfortable modeling our app as close to Yik-Yak as possible. Nevertheless, this was an oppurtunity to add features that were not in the original app that we think that users would benefit from based off our research.

  The main thing that differs our app from Yik-Yak is the college credential verification system. When users first download the app, they are going to be greeted by the account creation page, which allows them to make an account only if they enter their college credentials. Our research shows that most of our users would feel comfortable sharing this information. The account's default email will be the college email that they possess.

  Account creation is a one-time thing, and the user will be able to log in from this point on. It works similar to other apps where you log in once, and you're good to go on that device.

  The main feed page works almost exactly like the original Yik-Yak's feed page does, where when you use to be able to only see other posts in a certain radius, now you are able to see posts in a certain college. The user may filter the posts by newest or "hot" (high ratings). They can upvote or downvote all of the posts, and a new feature that we thought of is hashtags. Users can add hashtags to their posts and filter their feeds by that hashtag if they desire. When posting, users can decide to connect their handle to their posts, or if they want their posts to be anonymous.

  The profile works exactly like it did in the original Yik-Yak. Users may upload a profile pic, view every post they've ever made, and view their yakarma.

  In the original Yik-Yak app, people had different "herds". Different radiuses that the user can look at other then their own. This feature still exists, except with colleges. Users can locate different colleges given the map.

  When the user filters the posts by hashtags, the hashtags will appear at the top right above the feed. Users can remove the filtering by hashtag and go back to the original feed as they see fit.

  Lastly the settings page. If users do not feel comfortable with us using their school email for their account, then they can change their default college email to a custom email. They can also change the theme from dark and light.
