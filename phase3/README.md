Thank you for consent and your participation in this formative study for our app, Yak-Again. For the next 20 to 30 minutes, we are going to be observing you as you navigate the app and attempt to solve the problems that we present you with, as well as obtain your opinion on certain aspects of the app. Please keep in mind that we are testing the usability of our app, and not you. 

Before we begin, what are the types of social media that you use in your life? Have you used Yik-Yak before? <br/>
<strong>We’re hoping to get a baseline for our user, to see if they have any experience with the format of social media, and the specific format that Yik-Yak used as well, since it is slightly different from the normal social media interactions. </strong>


What are the kinds of problems that they solve for you? <br/>
<strong> Here we can find out what the primary use of social media is for our user. To see if Yik-Yak would be a good fit for them. </strong>


1.To start, please observe all of the fields that you would need to fill in to create an account. What are your general thoughts on them? (Moderator: Pay attention to their facial expressions). <br/>
<strong>This is the first step for anyone that wants to give Yak-Again a go, and is necessary before they can begin posting anything. If there is something about the signup process that they are confused about or don’t understand then we can make changes so that users will have the most efficient and effective way to sign-up. </strong>




1a. If the user doesn’t mention the fact that they need to give their college credentials, then ask them if they have any problems with giving them. <br/>
<strong>This question just clarifies any questions they might have around the college credentials. Even though we ask in our survey about it, here we have a chance for them to give a full response with their voiced opinion. </strong>


 2. You want to see what people are posting about the WREC. How can you see posts that are about the WREC?  (Moderator: time them) <br>
<strong>A key feature is the ability to filter your posts by a specific topic/hashtag that enables you to only see what you want to see. If the user is not able to effectively utilize this process then the whole purpose of it could be at risk if users aren’t able to use it at all.</strong>


3. You want to change your profile picture so that people will trust you more when meeting people in real life. What are the steps that you would go through to get that done?  (Moderator: time them) <br/>
<strong>Here a user needs to leave the home page and navigate to their ‘me’ page, it gives them a chance to look around different parts of the app and see what each of the tabs do. The process is a very basic process similar to most social media sites, so we are able to tell if we correctly mimicked the process.</strong>

4. Ask the user to “please ‘have a look around’ the app” and ask the user to describe a few of the pages that they come across. (Moderator: Pay attention to the order they looks at things and the time they spend on each section) <br/>
<strong>The user is meant to explore the entire app and see if they are able to learn what each page is and what its purpose is within the app. The pages aren’t very complex so if the user is able to describe the uses of all of the pages then we know that they are made well.</strong>










Summary/Conclusion Questions:

What are the features that stick out the most to you/intrigued you the most? 
Let’s us know what the user enjoyed the most about the app and what was the attention grabber in their opinion




What features would you add? 
The user can have input on things they would have liked to have seen during their walkthrought but weren’t able to.




What features would you take away? 
Anything that the user thought might have not been necessary or anything along the lines of that can be brought to our attention so that we can look at improving/removing any pieces that don't have a purpose.



The overall approach to our walkthrough is to allow the user a lot of leeway and freedom when testing the app. We want them to explore it at their own pace and talk aloud as they browse each page. We limited the specific tasks we want them to perform to primarily the new features that Yak-Again has that Yik-Yak did not. Besides those few features the user explores in their own order which allows us to see what pages are the most intriguing.
